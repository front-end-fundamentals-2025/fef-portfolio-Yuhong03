    <p class="start">About it</p>
    <p>Inspired by sleek modernism, this 3D model captures the essence of simplicity and elegance. Designed with clean lines and a minimalist silhouette, the bottle reflects a timeless appeal, perfect for any fragrance lover.</p>
    <p class="start">Modeling tool</p>
    <p>The project was created using Blender for the modeling process. The bottle and cap were built with detailed mesh structures, while materials and textures were applied to replicate the transparency of glass and the sheen of metal. The reflections and refractions of light on the bottle were meticulously crafted to showcase the natural luster of the materials.</p>
