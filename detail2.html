             <p>This CHANEL perfume bottle model uses Blender as the main modeling tool, and through its powerful functions, it accurately reproduces the elegance and classic design of the perfume bottle. The entire process focuses on the accurate representation of the bottle's proportions, material effects, and details.</p>
             <p class="typefont">Design details</p>
             <p>In the modeling of the CHANEL perfume bottle, the basic shape of the bottle is started, and the smooth edges are adjusted using subdivision surfaces to show its simple outline. The glass material of the bottle uses the Principled BSDF node, focusing on setting the transparency, refractive index (IOR) and reflection parameters to ensure that the light produces real refraction and reflection effects when passing through the bottle. The bottle cap uses a metal material, and the metal texture is simulated by setting the appropriate roughness and reflectivity. The exquisite light and shadow effects are rendered through Blender's Cycles renderer, which fully restores the appearance and material characteristics of the perfume bottle under different lighting conditions.</p>
