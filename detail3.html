        <p>Using Blender modeling, the Tamburins perfume bottle is highly restored in the model through its modern and avant-garde design, especially the curves and details of the bottle, which are finely processed through Blender's polygonal modeling technology, showing the brand's innovation and uniqueness.</p>
        <p class="typefont">Design details</p>
        <p>The modeling process of the Tamburins perfume bottle is complex. First, the Bezier curve tool is used to create the basic streamlined outline of the bottle, and then it is converted into a polygonal model. The curve smoothness of the bottle is controlled by gradually adjusting the vertices and edges. In terms of material, the perfume bottle uses a multi-layer glass material simulation, and uses Shader Mix to achieve the transition effect of different transparency, showing the change of light refraction from the bottle mouth to the bottle body.</p>
